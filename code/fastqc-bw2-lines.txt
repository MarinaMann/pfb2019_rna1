#zcat will decompress all .fastq.gz files in the directory specified
#stdin is name holder for a file in .fastq format. 
#FastQC will look for all files in this format in the directory supplied and run on them.
#we can output the fastqc results to a new directory, called 'fastqc-results' for file organization

=====================
#bowtie 2 alignment
#need to index the full arabidopsis genome! 

bowtie2-build --threads 10 GCF_000001735.4_TAIR10.1_genomic.fna.gz bw2-ara-indx

===================
#once index is done, begin alignments from within the "bowtie2-alignment" dir 
#I am going to chamge the file names once I make the smaller input fastqs

#The general format is: 
bowtie2 -p <#_of_threads> --mm -t --end-to-end -x <index> -1 <input.1.fq> -2 <input.2.fq> --un-conc-gz file-un-conc.fq.gz --al-conc-gz file-al-conc.fq.gz -S file-alignments.sam 2> file-output.stdout

------

#I'm putting together a script that combines these commands, to create short fastq files from the huge ones.
head -n 40000 <file.in> > <file.out>
tail -n 40000 <file.in> >> <file.out>
#notice that for the tail function, the output file name was the same file as for the head output.
#I used '>>' to append the results of tail, to the results of head.
#check that the correct number of lines are present:
wc -l <file.out>
#Should print 80000 lines. Remember, since it's a fastq file, line numbers need to be divisible by 4. 

-------

#Now, but the short files to test the bowtie2 commandline script
#I'm running my command line from the directory: pfb2019_rna1
#The output goes into a new directory I've pre-added, called: bw2-short-output
#The new short fastq files are stored in the directory named: fastq-files
